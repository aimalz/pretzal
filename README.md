# PRobability EsTimates over Z and ALpha (PRETZAL)

Welcome to the repository for a hack begun at the first LSST-DESC Hack Week project.  This project aims to explore how one might derive and use joint probability distributions over redshift ("z") and other parameters of galaxies (lumped into "alpha").

This hack aims to answer a couple questions about p(z,alpha) information: How should p(z,alpha) information be derived from photometry? How should p(z,alpha) information be used in inference?

The goal for the week is to produce the following: code for producing p(z,alpha) from photometry & code for doing inference with p(z,alpha)
